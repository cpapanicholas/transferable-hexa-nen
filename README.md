## Challenge Types
On-the-job ticket or feature request challenges give you starter code in a folder called Develop, which you'll modify to complete the challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format.

Job-seeking coding assessments or take-home assignments don't provide starter code. You'll build these from scratch. Even-numbered modules follow this format.
